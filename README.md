# space-invaders
game - a working project on space invaders

This project was created from watching 'The Coding Train' on youtube.

So far the invaders, ship, and missiles function by:
  - collision detection of missile and invaders that cause the ellipses disappear 
    + adjust missiles as they disappear upon reaching the center of the removed ellipse, may need to remove from array
  - missiles fire from the ship
    + a change needed is to adjust time delays between firing
    + adjust where the missile is fired from (in front of bow)
  - add a score (how many left?)
  - add additional rows of invaders
  - add a function that indicates a win when all invaders are removed
  - add a function that indicates a loss when the invaders reach the bottom
